# Face-Landmark-Prediction-and-Lipstick-Application
## Introduction 
Image of Human face was hard to detect, but after deep learning things have changed a lot. This Repository is an application of opencv and dlib.

## Things Done
* Prediction of face coordinates on real-time Webcam
* Prediction of 68 major Landmarks on face
* Applying gradient color lipstick on the mouth to get a real effect

## Structure of Repo
* There are two ways to explore my work 
* First check .ipynb notebook file which describes all in one
* Second check in the folder Python Scripts in which there are three script files and one .dat file. You can run scripts directly(see the dependencies heading first).
* There screenshot images in png format to see the output directly

## Dependencies
* Please install the dependencies which are required for executing the program
* Install cv2(opencv), ctype(for c++ codes), dlib(for detection and prediction models)
* On command line type [pip install cv2] [pip install ctype] [pip install dlib]
